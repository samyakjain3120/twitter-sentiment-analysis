# Twitter-Analysis

## Hi, In this repository I have made various model to predict that a tweet done by people is Racist or not.

State of Natural Language Processing is used in the models for the Text data.

Three models have been made :- 

1.) TF-IDF and Naive Bayes - In this I have converted the text data into vectors with the help of TF-IDF technique and furthur made a machine learning model with the technique of                              Naive bayes.

2.) Word Embeddings and ANN - In this I have converted the text data into vectors with the help of Word Embedding technique and furthur made a Neural Network model.

3.) Word Embeddings and LSTM - In this I have converted the text data into vectors with the help of Word Embedding technique and furthur made a LSTM model.

4.) Word Embeddings and Bidirectional LSTM - In this I have converted the text data into vectors with the help of Word Embedding technique and furthur made a Bidirectional LSTM model.

### From the Above models best Accuracy of 89.99% is given by Bidirectional LSTM Model
